# D3-challenge

For the D3-Challenge the task was to create a scatter plot between the rates of income, obesity, poverty and smoking of US states.

In order to do this, we needed to use HTML, JavaScript and specifically the library D3 in order to create an interactive scatter plot that is able to change its X and Y axis.
